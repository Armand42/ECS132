## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

 ```{r cars}
# summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Problem 1


## 1.

```
Var(X - Y) = Var[X + (-Y)] = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2Cov(X, Y) (mailing tube (3.73))

Let X and Y be independent random variables. Then, E(XY) = E(X) * E(Y).

By definition, Cov(U, V) = E(UV) - E(U) * E(V)  (mailing tube (3.72)).

Thus, in this problem, Cov(X, Y) = E(XY) - E(X) * E(Y)
                                 = E(XY) - E(XY)
                                 = 0

Thus, when X and Y are independent, then Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)

# Problem 2

```{r, echo=TRUE}

```



# Problem 3



# Problem 4
1. The values the random variable can take are {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), ( 4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)}
2. The PMF is:

| X| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| P(x) | 1/16  | 2/16  | 3/16 | 4/16  | 3/16 | 2/16 | 1/16

3. The Expected value of X is:

`E(x) = x*f(x) = 2*(1/16) + 3*(2/16) + 4*(3/16) + 5*(4/16) + 6(3/16) + 7*(2/16) + 8*(1/16) = 80/16`

 
# Problem 5

## 1.

```
The PMF of x:
    P(x = X) = nCx * p^x * (1-p)^n-x
    P = 0.97, n = 10
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
 X <- 0:10

plot(dbinom(X,10,0.97), col="black", main = "Binomial Distribution", xlab = "Number of chips Produced", ylab = "Probability") 
```


 
## 2.

The rate of failure p' = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1-pbinom(1,10,0.03)
```
