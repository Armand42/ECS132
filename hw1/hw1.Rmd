# Problem 2

Looking to solve:

- P(c = 0 | X1 = X2)
- P(c = 1 | X1 = X2)
- P(c = 2 | X1 = X2)


## 0 Collisions

```
P(c = 0 | X1 = X2) = P(c = 0 | X1 = X2 = 1) + P(c = 0 | X1 = X2 = 2)
               
P(c = 0 | X1 = X2 = 1 ) = P(w/ 2 active nodes, only 1 sends for epoch 1) * [P(no activate and the one active does not send) + P(activate and X2=1) ]
                        = 2p(1-p) * [(1-q)(1-p) + q2p(1-p)]
                        = 0.24192
                          
P(c = 0 | X1 = X2 = 2) = P(w/ 2 active nodes, neither send, epoch 1) * P(w/ 2 active nodes, neither send, epoch 2)
                        = (1-p)(1-p) * (1-p)(1-p)
                        = 0.1296

=> P(c = 0 | X1 = X2) = 0.24192 + 0.1296 = 0.37152
```

## 1 Collision
